   Given entityset, perform a 
    "Best match" on each entity, yielding
	   ranked alternative representations 
	   and potentially a type 
	   
	 key :  { Word /Synonym /Regex 
	   / Extractionrule } -> { prop TrueWord , 
	                           Category: XX  }
	   
	If the Category is already present, it's highly preferred
	(or even filtered) matching categories. 

Problem: how to treat generic words which we don't know, 
like UV2, UVX	 -> Regex, Extrationrule   UV2CLNT000 -> SystemId UV2, client: 000
	   


This yields a [set of] ( uncategorized properties)
